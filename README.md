"Superstore Sales" generally refers to the sales data and performance of a superstore or a large retail store that offers a wide range of products and merchandise. These superstores are typically known for their extensive inventory, competitive pricing, and one-stop shopping experience.
The dashboard made by me shows superstore sales analysis. The analyses are intended for store owners, managers, and analysts to understand the store's performance, identify trends, and make informed business decisions. 
Tools used: Excel, Power Query.
